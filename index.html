        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I have always enjoyed programming and I have recently decided that I would like to change my career to Software development. I started learning web design as a hobby in the past and have retained enough knowledge to introduce Javascript
          into my programming practices. The main language I use though is Python. I have made many pieces of software from web scrapers to roguelike games.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I already have a grasp of most of the basic libraries in Python and use of JavaScript within the script and canvas elements. Listed here are some extra libraries that I find worth pointing out as an extra skillset.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Flask.</li>
            <li>Django - <small>basics more than good knowledge of.</small></li>
            <li>Web Scraping - <small>requests, beautifulsoup.</small></li>
            <li>Pygame.</li>
            <li>PyOpenGL.</li>
            <li>OpenCV - <small>currently learning.</small></li>
          </ul>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <ul>
            <li>jQuery - <small>currently learning.</small></li>
            <li>Rot.js - <small>currently learning.</small></li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
