      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I have always enjoyed programming and I have recently decided that I would like to change my career to Software development. I started learning web design as a hobby in the past and have retained enough knowledge to introduce Javascript into my programming practices. The main language I use though is Python. I have made many pieces of software from web scrapers to roguelike games.</p>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>I already have a grasp of most of the basic libraries in Python and use of JavaScript within the script and canvas elements. Listed here are some extra libraries that I find worth pointing out as an extra skillset.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Flask</li>
          <li>Django - <em>basics more than good knowledge of</em></li>
          <li>Web Scraping - <em>requests, beautifulsoup</em></li>
          <li>Pygame</li>
          <li>PyOpenGL</li>
          <li>OpenCV - <em>currently learning</em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
